<h1 style="margin-left: 50px" class="polya">| Project 1: Low Poly</h1>


<br>

<p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 550px">Low poly art is a 3D mesh that has a relatively low number of polygons.
It simplifies the shape of the 3D object to a point when it is still recognizable.
This art, despite appearing of low aesthetic quality, its purpose was to resemble reality. It is not a descriptive illustration, but a simulative one. It lacks surreal outlines and attitudes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 550px">
				I chose this example because I am fascinated with Blender, a 3D modeling software that allows you to easily create any kind of object, effect, or environment, including the low poly technique. Also, this method is visually curious. At first, it looks like origami and makes one wonder at the level of detail in a larger environment like the one that can be seen in the video (available if you click on the photo) to the right. It seems to be a whole world of paper, although, in reality, it is an arduous effort of modeling in a low mesh.</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 550px">This technique is more time saving and graphically simple, in terms that it is easier to render and produce. This fact gives it many points in favor as many artists and platforms declare Low Poly as their style. Among the best-known examples are the Unity3D platform, Blender, and many audiovisual productions. Part of the reason for choosing this as the style of something is also that it appears to be very detailed work, and it is not so much. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 40%">				
To make this possible, I spent some time doing research and organizing the sequence of the making process. My work emerged from separate features: one is that 3D terrain of polygons. Because I learned how to make this terrain move, I shifted to the idea of representing an ocean. An ocean, so immense that you can get lost in it. So I want to make the visitor take a story-like voyage through a virtual reality ocean. It would take them through this turbulent waves, just like the agitated stars in the sky, with a lonely moon. However, at the end of every ocean, you can find land. Hence I created the island, which is the known withing the unknown. </p>
				<p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 40%">The island would be the salvation of this surreal environment. It is the peace we find when we are overwhelmed in a strange scenario and find something we can relate with. This is a classic and well-known representation of reality. </p>

				<p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 40%">A next feature, and most importantly, was then to create this feeling of being part of the scene, so the only way was to make the user the cause of the movement in the landscape. I used poseNet in javascript to track the user's nose. All of this was to make the camera move. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 40%"> Furthermore, I wanted to make every part of the scene have a meaning, and the sky would have a lot. I took as inspiration the 'Starry night' of Van Gogh. This piece represents a dream, and that is exactly the feeling I want to convey.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 40%">
Connecting to my beginning, I have used low poly aesthetics and connected it with a virtual environment, controlled by the user's movements. To take this toward future development, I am considering to keep representing the sense of immensity in virtual reality, modernizing the concepts of this aesthetics and giving it my personal signature. For that, I will have to apply all these experiments into a platform that supports them and much more. </p>

					<br>
					<br>
						<h7>I am a student at Dubai Institute of Design and Innovation. My preferences in design go around Product and Multimedia, because I would like to know how to combine those concentrations and make a useful, meaningful, and durable design.</h7>
					<h7>My main motivation with Multimedia courses is, in general, to learn graphic visualization techniques. I want to be able to convey meaningful messages through beautiful graphics. I love VFX, animations, 3D modeling for cinematic purposes, and I intend to specialize in some terms related to that. I am also open to change the course of my life while discovering new things in my time at DIDI.</h7>
