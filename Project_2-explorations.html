<h1 style="margin-left: 50px" class="polya">| Project 2: Virtual Reality</h1>
<br>


<p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 40%">				
This phase is dedicated to explorations and planifications for my project 2. After the first work about a Low Poly environment, my goals for the next level is to develop it in a greater platform. I learned previously that using p5js is too restrictive for purposes that include importing and working with 3D objects. However, that experimentation helped me understand the elements of a 3D environment, such as the camera and lights, to mention but a few. Three.js allows me to work with those resources without the fear of malfunctioning. The process is going to be hard, but with a good planning I expect to achieve it. </p>

<h5 style="margin-left: 50%; margin-right: 550px"> 1. Create a local server</h5>

<div class="row" style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 10%">
	<div class="column" style="width: 45%">

		<p style="margin-left: 5%">				
		To make this possible, I used Node.js for Windows. This application lets you create a local server, which is beneficial to create projects with bigger resolution and with much more freedom to develop javascript. This allows me to use Three.js and use several 3D objects created by myself and others, without the restrictions of p5js.  </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 5%">				
		As seen, my new local server can be accessed from any browser with the link <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080">http://127.0.0.1:8080</a> .  </p>

<h5 style="margin-left: 50%; margin-right: 550px"> 2. Create a scene</h5>

<div class="row" style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 10%">
	<div class="column" style="width: 45%">
		<img src="../Mariam-Lambertt/My references/setup.png"  height="550" style="width:75%"></a>

		By start with my project, I followed some tutorials about creating a scene in Three.js . Initially, i created a rotating cube, an ambient light, and a camera capable of zoom into the object, rotate around it, and to move apart form it. This inspired me to use that camera feature into my final project. I would like to let the user, while wearing a VR headset, to move around the scene seamlessly, without having to interact with any object. As well, I discovered that any object created in my scene could be displayed as wireframes, instead of having a colour or material. This look will give my concept an abstract idea, and I find very interesting to shift a casual and friendly Low Poly aesthetic into a modern, elegant, and monochromatic aesthetic. However it will still respect some ofthe original charasterics such as geometry, low mesh, polygons, repeated patterns, and it proximity to reality.</p>

<h5 style="margin-left: 50%; margin-right: 550px"> 3. Connecting with VR</h5>

<div class="row" style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 10%">
	<div class="column" style="width: 45%">
		<img src="../Mariam-Lambertt/My references/cb.jpg"  height="550" style="width:100%"></a>
	</div>
	<div class="column" style="width: 45%">
		<p style="margin-left: 5%">				
		During this stage my goal is to connect my scene with the VR headset. To do so, I must get my server to worlk in my mobile. Whilst I achieve that, I decided to continue working on a finished scene and researched enough the behaviours of my program.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 5%">				
		In addition, my goal with the VR headsets is to not only to orbit the camera on its default position, but to move along the user.</p>

						<h8 id="About" >About me</h8>

					<br>
					<br>
						<h7>I am a student at Dubai Institute of Design and Innovation. My preferences in design go around Product and Multimedia, because I would like to know how to combine those concentrations and make a useful, meaningful, and durable design.</h7>
					<h7>My main motivation with Multimedia courses is, in general, to learn graphic visualization techniques. I want to be able to convey meaningful messages through beautiful graphics. I love VFX, animations, 3D modeling for cinematic purposes, and I intend to specialize in some terms related to that. I am also open to change the course of my life while discovering new things in my time at DIDI.</h7>
